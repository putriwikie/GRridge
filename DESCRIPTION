Description: This package allows the use of multiple sources of co-data
        (e.g. external p-values, gene lists, annotation) to improve
        prediction of binary, continuous and survival response using
        (logistic, linear or Cox) group-regularized ridge regression.
        It also facilitates post-hoc variable selection and prediction
        diagnostics by cross-validation using ROC curves and AUC.
